# Jekyll Brochureware Site

Got a friend who's starting a business, and you're the techy friend they called 
for a website? This jekyll template can get you a site up and running in a few 
minutes (hosted free on GitHub) that can be configured lickety split.

Most of the site-specific stuff is in the _config.yml, so change some lines and 
build the site out and you're pretty much there.
